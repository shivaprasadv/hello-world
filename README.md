# hello-world

Getting started with GitHub.

I am a hobby programmer and web-developer. I code mainly C++ and HTML/CSS. I'm a great fan of open source and free software.

Looking forward to using GitHub!

# cloning hello-world 

Okay, so I cloned the repository to my workstation, and made some changes.

Learning the basics of git in the process!

Next steps:
  * Stage new file .gitignore
  * Stage modified file README.md
  * Review the differences
  * Commit the changes
